# US-Road-Fatality-Report

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The following report provides a step by step guide to analyze the U.S. traffic fatality crashes happened in the year 2015-2016. The purpose of this tutorial is to strengthen the problem solving and analytical skills of the user using Tableau Desktop. The tutorial will provide the user with detailed explanations of different features and functionality of Tableau and how it can be used to explore the research question.  The user will gain insights about the data provided by nhtsa (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and skills to present the findings in a visually interactive way. The user will be able to explore the data using descriptive and diagnostic analytics. This tutorial will enable the user to solve business problem using the 5Wâ€™s (Why, What, When, Where, Why) based on the research question.

## BACKGROUND:

Road Accidents is a serious problem in United Sates resulting in injuries, fatalities and economic loss. The research question of this tutorial is to find out the factors that causes road fatalities in U.S. This research is initiated by the U.S. department of Transportation. The reason they want to conduct this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of current safety programs. 
The aim of the department is to understand the problem in-depth and analyze the research findings. This analysis will enable the department to better strategize, plan and implement safety programs. 
The department needs an interactive report on the findings of last two-year (2015-2016) fatality crashes happened in U.S. It is important for the department to understand the characteristics of the past crashes which includes the environmental factors, trafficways, Collison nature and impairment due to alcohol. 
The department wants their business intelligence team to display the findings using an interactive data visualization tool. These interactive visualizations based on Tableau dashboard and storyboard will be presented to their security teams. The goal is to make everyone understand the findings quickly.
